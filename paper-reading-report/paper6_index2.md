#Characterizing and Detecting Performance Bugs for Smartphone Applications

##Research Questions

- RQ1 (Bug types and impacts):

    What are common types of performance bugs in Android applications? What impacts do they have on user experience?


- RQ2 (Bug manifestation):

    How do performance bugs manifest themselves? Does their manifestation need special inputs?

- RQ3 (Debugging and bug-fixing effort):

    Are performance bugs more difficult to debug and fix than non-performance bugs? What information or tools can help with this?
- RQ4 (Common bug patterns):

    Are there common causes of performance bugs? Can we distill common bug patterns to facilitate performance analysis and bug detection?
